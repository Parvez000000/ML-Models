🐦 Bird Species Classification using InceptionV3

This project is a deep learning-based bird species classification model built using InceptionV3 with fine-tuning. The model takes bird images as input and predicts the bird species accurately by leveraging the powerful feature extraction capabilities of pretrained convolutional neural networks.

📌 Project Highlights
Utilizes InceptionV3 pretrained on ImageNet.

Fine-tuned on a custom bird species dataset.

Achieves high accuracy through transfer learning and data augmentation.

Suitable for real-time or batch image classification tasks.
